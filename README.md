I made this project just to try my hands on a little Front End and Back End using flask. \
As someone who tries to solve leetcode problems every other day, I find this idea and this website very useful and fun to work with. Thanks for insipiring [Siddhant](https://x.com/sidcodes/status/1790802245719630042)

### Next to do :
- [ ] need to get embeddings for codeforces problems (if you can help me out here, please your boy up)
- [ ] toggle or option to switch between leetcode and codeforces
- [ ] beautify (maybe?)
